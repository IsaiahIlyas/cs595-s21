### Course Objectives

The goal of this course is to review common web security vulnerabilities
and exploits, as well as their corresponding defenses.  There is
an inherent tension between "web as simple document reader" and
"web as application environment", and as the functionality of the
web ecosystem increases, so do the vulnerabilities.

General concepts that students will learn: principles of web security,
attacks and countermeasures, the browser security model, web app
vulnerabilities, injection, denial-of-service, TLS attacks, privacy,
fingerprinting, same-origin policy, cross site scripting, authentication,
JavaScript security, emerging threats, defense-in-depth, techniques
for writing secure code, web archiving, rehosting.

Specific technologies that students will learn: Git/GitHub,
DOM/Javascript, CLI, Node.js, Twitter, Youtube.

### Course Inspiration

This course is based on [CS 253 Web Security, Stanford, Fall
2019](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs253/).  Special thanks to
[Feross Aboukhadijeh](https://feross.org/) for generously sharing
his course materials (although any errors are mine).
